In many urban areas, improper waste segregation and the lack of incentives for recycling lead to overflowing landfills and environmental pollution. Sortify addresses this by:
* **Incentivizing Recycling:** By offering tangible rewards (points redeemable for cash), the app motivates users to segregate and recycle their waste properly.
* **Organizing Waste Collection:** It provides a structured system for users to list their recyclable items and schedule pickups, making the process efficient for both users and collectors.
* **Promoting a Circular Economy:** By ensuring that recyclable materials are collected and processed, Sortify contributes to a more sustainable, circular economy.
